# Election-Audit Summary: 

Full circle, the data collected for the Colorado Board of Elections results turned out to not only have useful data which determined the votes collected per County but the percentage as well and the winning  candidate. This script can be modified to not only do the same for County votes but for all types of elections. Modified, this script can even present the data such as voters per county vs voters that actually voted. The data collected can help kickstart a campaign to help push voters to vote. The results can provide data to voters showing how their vote can provide a different result in future elections.
